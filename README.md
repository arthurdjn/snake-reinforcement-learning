# AI plays Snake Game :snake:


**PySnake** is an artificial intelligence that learns to control a snake. This AI learns to recognize its environment and choose the best direction to survive.
This model uses Genetic Algorithm theory, as there is no training data available.

The game is simple. The player / AI control a snake in four directions : UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible, increasing the snake's length.
The snake dies when it eats itself or crash in a wall.

### SAGA

[SAGA](https://documentation.sigma2.no/quick/saga.html) is a distributed memory system which consists of 244 dual/quad socket nodes, interconnected with a high-bandwidth low-latency InfiniBand network. The model has been trained on [SAGA](https://documentation.sigma2.no/quick/saga.html) servers with an access of 16GB ram and 8 nodes, through 1000 generations of 1500 snakes each.

## Getting Started

### Install

To install, clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/arthurdjn/pysnake
```

Note that pysnake requires [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to visualize the game.
I you installed **pysnake** through pip `pip install .`, it will automatically download all required dependencies. Otherwise, use:

```
$ pip install pygame
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install json
```

### Config

The application settings are available from the `config.ini` file. You can create a custom one, as long as you have the necessary parameters.
  

### Play

You can play and launch the application by running the following command:
```
$ python pysnake
```
This will call the `pysnake/__main__.py` file and execute your command.
If you choose to render the game, you should see a pop-up window like this:


![intro](img/pysnake_intro.png)

To play the game, use :
- `UP ARROW` to move up,
- `LEFT ARROW` to move left,
- `DOWN ARROW` to move down,
- `RIGHT ARROW` to move right,
- `SPACE BAR` to pause the game,
- `r` to restart the game,
- `v` to render the snake's vision,
- `g` to display the game grid


You can turn it off with `render = False` in the `config.ini` file.


There are more key arguments that you can used to launch the application:
- `--mode`: run either a playble or trainable game,
- `--config`: read a custom config file,
- `--snake`: run a snake from a saved file. The snake will play automatically in an unseen environment,
- `--replay`: run a snake from a saved file, in the same environment it was originally saved,
- `--population`: train snakes from an existing population.


#### Examples

By default, the game mode used is `play`.
If you just want to play the game, you can explicitly use in addition the `--mode` key argument:
```
$ python pysnake --mode play
```
You can specify `--mode train` to train snakes.

If you created a custom config.ini, specify it each time you run pysnake:
```
$ python pysnake --config path/to/your/config.ini
```

Snakes and generations can be saved. Change the default parameters in the `config.ini` files.
Even though saving the best snakes for X generations depends on your needs, I recommend that you save some of your generations, in case your computer / server shuts down. Saving generations with a `saving_steps = 50` prevents you to starting the simulation from zero if something (bad) happens.

Once snakes are saved, load them with one of these commands:

```
$ python pysnake --snake pysnake/snake.json
```

```
$ python pysnake --replay pysnake/snake.json
```

```
$ python pysnake --mode train --population pysnake/saves/generation_1500
```

## Development

PySnake architecture depends on 3 elements:
- `snake's vision`,
- `neural network`,
- `genetic algorithm`.

### Vision

The snake's vision is composed of rays (lines) going from its head to the game borders. These rays are equally spaced, the range depends on the `vision_mode` parameters (goes from 1 to +infinity). The vision can be visualized as a LiDAR sensor.

# References

I started this project when I saw the [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhiO4WsHA6c) from [Chrisspresso](https://github.com/Chrispresso/SnakeAI).
I read his [project page](https://chrispresso.io/AI_Learns_To_Play_Snake) and then wanted to create my own version.
The architecture is somewhat similar, but the vision and game are coded differently. In addition, I added a web visualizer so anyone can play with the project :smiley: !
